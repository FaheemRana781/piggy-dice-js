# piggy-dice-js
Pig game implemented with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Designed for two players, the game involves rolling a dice to accumulate points. Players take turns rolling the dice, and the first to reach 100 points wins. Rolling a 1 ends the current turn and forfeits the accumulated points for that turn, adding an element of strategy.
